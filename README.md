A few example scripts from my Master's research (September 2010 - March 2013). The driver script is BayesianHierarchicalModels.r, and that calls the other scripts. These fit, evalualte, and plot the Bayesian hierarchical models presented in this paper: https://meganstachura.com/papers/Linking%20Northeast%20Pacific%20recruitment%20synchrony%20to%20environmental%20variability.pdf
